class Message;

// The underlying implementation of cross-node (typically cross-process)
// communication via socket primitives. This object gets created synchronously
// on whatever thread the Mage embedder calls operations that trigger its
// creation (i.e., sending or accepting an invitation). This class is
// responsible for IO, and as such, implements the `SocketReader` interface
// whose concrete implementation is provided by the Mage embedder. This leads to
// two interesting interactions that `this` has with the embedder-provided IO
// mechanism:
//   1. WRITE: Messages sent over `this` are written (to the underlying IO
//      mechanism managed by `SocketReader`) ON THE THREAD that triggered
//      `SendMessage()`. That is, we don't necessarily have a dedicated thread
//     for sending messages; this can happen on any thread.
//   2. READ: By `this` implementing the `SocketReader` interface, the Mage
//      embedder can tell us (on the thread that *it* does IO on), when a
//      message can be read from the underlying socket mechamism managed by
//      `SocketReader`. This will likely be on a dedicated IO thread (for
//      example, when the //base library [1] is being used by the Mage
//      embedder), but that is not technically required or enforced.
//
// One major corollary that follows from the above is that reading and writing
// messages can happen on different threads. Furthermore, since many threads can
// use `this` to write/send multiple messages to the same process at the same
// time, it is expected that the underlying socket mechanism (typically Unix
// domain sockets on Linux or Mach Ports on macOS) is thread-safe, as `this`
// does not provide a thread-safe abstraction on top of it.
